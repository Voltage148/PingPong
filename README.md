Welcome to my new project!!!

This is a pingpong game for windows.It's CLI(Console Base program).
I made it just for fun :) and you can use it or join to this project.

How does it work:
    The Program has 5 Source File:

    1->PingMain.cpp --> It is the Main file. the main function is in it.

    2->NeedFunctions.h --> This file has importent functions for Program.

    3->Ground.h --> This file has a class named PlayGround for Control and show playground.

    4->Players.h --> Player Class and CPU Class is in it. it controls the player movements and process the CPU player.

    5->Ball.h --> that file controls the Ball movement and the win logic.


How to Compile:
    You just write : g++ .\PingMain.cpp -o ..\Releases\PingPong.exe -stdc++=17

Thanks for visiting my project :)
